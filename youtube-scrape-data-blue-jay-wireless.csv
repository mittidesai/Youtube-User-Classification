https://www.youtube.com/user/JohnnyReedShow/about,Johnny Reed","MUSIC VIDEOS of Recording Artist: Johnny Reed from the CD's: "The Johnny Reed Show" and  RAWK DAWG "Rock With an ATTITUDE" and RAWK DAWG "We Only Came to ROCK"","“Third Time’s a Charm” released 11/1/2015 is Johnny Reed’s 5th album release.  Feb. 2016 “Perceptions” was #1 on MusicWeMake.com. Johnny’s releases are "Solo albums in their purest form”. On all Five (5) albums Johnny's doing everything writing all the songs doing all the vocals & playing all the instruments. Johnny Reed calls his one-man band "The Johnny Reed Show".   Johnny’s first 2 albums “Rock With an ATTITUDE” & “We Only Came to Rock” were Hard Driving Rock as front man for his eccentric group “RAWK DAWG”. Spring 2003 the song “Lost in the Night” was #1 on College 500 on C500.com.  Johnny’s New Pop Rock direction channels the emotion of classic rock greats like Paul McCartney Crosby Stills & Nash Tom Petty Elton John Phil Collins and the philosophic consciousness of Bob Dylan and is capturing the current Pop Rock Music FANS of Taylor Swift & Bruno Mars. The Songs are story songs of Life whatever Johnny wants to sing about. On “Third Time’s a Charm” Johnny stretches his musical wings further and flies through relationships social issues and life’s challenges. Johnny’s own life challenges inspire him to write about Life as Johnny's daughter had a car accident that left her with a Traumatic Brain Injury requiring 24hr care.  Johnny records in his own studio THE MUSIC ROOM ® in Redondo Beach CA  where he has also done the Voice of KING KONG for Universal Pictures® /Peter Jackson been a consultant to James Cameron for the TITANIC as well as created hundreds of other unique audio/visual projects for major entertainment companies. Johnny is currently working on his 6th album “FORTRESS” due out in Summer 2017.

https://www.youtube.com/user/s7yler/about,s7yler","I'm a technology nerd who is fascinated by smartphones tablets and gadgets. I have worked with mobile devices the last 15 years (my first phone was a Nokia 3210 in 1999 and my first computer was a Commodore 16 64 and later Amiga).  My channel is all about smartphones/tablets/accessories gadgets & cars mainly from Asia/China. I do this for fun and in my private spare time (I have a fulltime job and family besides being a Youtuber). I use my channel here to share my tips tricks and educate you about them.  If you have or know any good PRODUCTS that you want me to TEST or PROMOTE then you are welcome to contact me. I'm originally from Denmark but have lived in Germany for the last 7 years. So I can speak/write in English German and Danish.  Please like & subscribe for more TECH videos and thanks for watching!
