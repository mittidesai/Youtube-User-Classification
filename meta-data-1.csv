We set up this channel to show all the crazy stuff he does and the fun he has. We also put up tips we learnt ourselves as bulldog owners. Bubba's pedigree is old school at its finest- 100% Johnson champion bloodlines. Conformationally correct from front to back he is a real show dog. He weighs about 125lbs lean but is very athletic and a clean breather. His best attribute is his wonderful happy temperament. Highly intelligent with great guarding instincts he loves kids and other animals. Bubba is equally at ease in the big city traffic and crowded spaces of Los Angeles as well as hiking out in nature swimming in the lake doing cross country road trips to visit National monuments like Mount Rushmore Pueblos in different states National Parks etc.   Thanks for subscribing to the channel and following his adventures.,null,https://plus.google.com/116107581228244773975,

We set up a YouTube channel for Charlie in January 2013 as we began training him to complete tasks ranging from helpful (shutting cabinet doors) to amusing (bringing a can of beer and the TV remote straight to the couch). After our beautiful baby was born we noticed his special bond with our daughter and we began filming our canine companion as he helped us care for her.  Charlie the dog was introduced to baby Laura the moment she came home. We taught him how to help change her diapers swing her baby crib and play gently with her. But the one thing we never had to teach him is how to love our daughter. Charlie showed us how babies and dogs can be the best of friends and he demonstrates that he is an important part of our family and the unconditional love and and joy he provides is immeasurable.,null,https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charlie/157486427782271,https://twitter.com/Charliedadog201,https://instagram.com/charlie_the_beagle_and_laura_o/,https://plus.google.com/112437437015447498736,

I have a BFA degree in Creative Writing and find myself drawn to the questions most creative enthusiasts are drawn to: how to generate new ideas and how to stand out from the crowd as I do it.  For ten years I have contemplated these two questions almost exclusively during my creative work (academic work as well as personal).   Your journey of creativity is individual to you and I hope I get to know you through that journey regardless of where it takes you or how you choose to use it. My goal is to not only boost your creativity but to help you make money from your creativity! Just as I have been doing!  Tatiana is now teaching online to help kickstart your creativity!

I would like to thank all of you who have subscribed to my channel and also those of you who leave wonderful comments.  I read them all and cherish them.  I'm sorry I don't have the time to respond to each one and I apologize that I don't SUB for SUB but know that your enjoyment of my cats and kittens is what has me running for the camera every time I see something cute happening which is a LOT.  My videos are more of a 'slice of life' than a production which allows me to upload more often so please check back for almost daily and sometimes multiple in a day videos.  I wish each of you a big smile each and every day -- Molly Barr  IF YOU WONDER WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO A SPECIFIC KITTEN AFTER ADOPTION check the playlists. A few have YT channels.

We are a band of pet lovers and pet parents dedicated to providing your pet with a safe fun and caring environment in your absence. We believe in a personalized approach to pet care ensuring your peace-of-mind knowing your pet is safe happy and loved while you’re away.  Once upon a time my wife and I had 9-to-5 careers. But our fantasy was to create an environment where we could bring our dogs to work every day – to re-create the fun of a neighborhood dog park where it's always doggy social hour.  In this fantasy we knew we wanted a place that let pets do the things that they love to do. We wanted to provide individualized attention love and care. We set up camp in May 1997. It's been an amazing journey. We are grateful to our camp counselors our campers and our campers’ parents who allow us the privilege of caring for their dogs and cats.,null,http://www.petcamp.com/,https://www.facebook.com/PetCamp/,https://twitter.com/PetCamp,https://www.pinterest.com/petcamp/,https://www.instagram.com/petcampsf/,https://plus.google.com/114549116161116327679,
