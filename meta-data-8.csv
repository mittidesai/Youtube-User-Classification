We go to great lengths to capture the wonderful world of bunnies like you've never seen it before.  We also throw in an occasional dose of cute from other animal families as well to keep everyone honest.  The channel started with the original bunny Booboo a pure-bred blue-eyed white holland lop bunny and the award winning bunny family.  Our projects have taken us to the world famous Mimi Rabbit Cafe in Tokyo and Okunoshima a small remote island off the coast of Japan that is populated by thousands of feral bunnies that has recently come to popularity after our video series hit the Internet.  More recently we captured amazing footage during out trip to Tashirojima also known as "Cat Island" due to the large stray (yet cute!) cat population that has now exceeded the number of local inhabitants on the island.

https://www.youtube.com/user/RowdieTheDog/about,Cute Cats Kwazi and Uli","461","57878","Cute funny kittens Kwazi & Uli were saved with help from the Hawaiian Humane Society on August 17 2013. They were both 2 months old male and seemed to get along at the pound.   Kwazi the black kitten came from a stray litter in a pile of lumber somewhere.   Uli the tabby came from a home.   Kwazi is very cuddly and loving but shy around strangers.  He can jump and catch balls in the air and likes to "wash" his toys in his water bowl before hiding them under furniture or the stove.  Uli is an assertive extrovert and "official greeter" in our home. He is our ADHD cat always running jumping and doing crazy things.  He also likes to see on his pedestal (a tall cat scratch post we bought that no one scratches).  Kwazi and Uli immediately became best buddies as well as funny crazy rough and tumble sparring partners.  Hope you enjoy them!","null,https://plus.google.com/117107514413033422174","

When I drive I like to play dramatic music that makes me feel like I'm out to save the world. I love bad scifi movies and have seen way too many with Mega Piranha currently holding my #1 spot. My cat judges me if I don't make my bed in the morning. I program stuff on computers. That is all.   There are few things better in life than a good laugh. As long as I can keep at least one person laughing I'll be here. :)  Current LPs:  - Dead Space 3 (PS3 blind) - Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII (PS3 blind) - Mass Effect 3 (PC) - The Black Mirror II (PC blind) - Fallout 4 (PS4 blind) - Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin (PS4 blind)  In addition the second weekend of every month is Short LP Weekend where I will play through an entire short game over the course of that weekend.

There are many audiobook & radio show channels but my channel is unique. First my channel offers intellectual exercise in a true sense of words. I provide either interesting or intellectually stimulating items only. I update daily and I strive to create a completely unique place for the people who are fed up with mainstream shallow cultures. Second I DO extensive quality control. Some channels are just posting random books without any quality control to just increase books' numbers so that they can reach the status of "Featured Channel." But I choose 'quality' over 'quantity' and 'uniqueness' over 'general appeal.' Thank you. PS: The picture of the book in my channel icon was taken by Dr. Marcus Gossler.

After our beautiful baby was born we noticed his special bond with our daughter and we began filming our canine companion as he helped us care for her.  Charlie the dog was introduced to baby Laura the moment she came home. We taught him how to help change her diapers swing her baby crib and play gently with her. But the one thing we never had to teach him is how to love our daughter.

https://www.youtube.com/user/SportingDogPro/about,Sporting Dog Pro","174","116562","Since 1982 our family has been hunting with and training dogs in the field and at home. We began running hounds at the Tuscarora Hunting Club in North Carolina with our father and eventually moved to upland hunting with pointers later on. Nowadays we tend to lean more towards waterfowl hunting with our retrievers. If it wasn't for the obedience of our faithful canine companions we would have stopped hunting long ago.  The significance of having a well-trained dog is so important to us and our way of life that we ultimately decided to pass on our knowledge and expertise to the canine world by sharing the tools we use to train our dogs.  Sporting Dog Pro is a family owned and operated sporting dog supply company based in Charlotte North Carolina. We are knowledgeable dog enthusiasts who utilize the products we sell and make it our priority to service our customers and support the hunting dog community.","null,https://www.SportingDogPro.com","http://www.facebook.com/SportingDogPro","https://twitter.com/SportingDogPro","https://plus.google.com/116196136039889929249","
