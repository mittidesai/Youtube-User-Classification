We also throw in an occasional dose of cute from other animal families as well to keep everyone honest.  The channel started with the original bunny Booboo a pure-bred blue-eyed white holland lop bunny and the award winning bunny family.  Our projects have taken us to the world famous Mimi Rabbit Cafe in Tokyo and Okunoshima a small remote island off the coast of Japan that is populated by thousands of feral bunnies that has recently come to popularity after our video series hit the Internet.  More recently we captured amazing footage during out trip to Tashirojima also known as \"Cat Island\" due to the large stray (yet cute!) cat population that has now exceeded the number of local inhabitants on the island.

      "\tCute funny kittens Kwazi & Uli were saved with help from the Hawaiian Humane Society on August 17 2013. They were both 2 months old male and seemed to get along at the pound.   Kwazi the black kitten came from a stray litter in a pile of lumber somewhere.   Uli the tabby came from a home.   Kwazi is very cuddly and loving but shy around strangers.  He can jump and catch balls in the air and likes to \"wash\" his toys in his water bowl before hiding them under furniture or the stove.  Uli is an assertive extrovert and \"official greeter\" in our home. He is our ADHD cat always running jumping and doing crazy things.  He also likes to see on his pedestal (a tall cat scratch post we bought that no one scratches).  Kwazi and Uli immediately became best buddies as well as funny crazy rough and tumble sparring partners.  Hope you enjoy them!\n",

His mother was short-haired cat. HAL was the only kitten long-haired.  He is calm and full of curiosity. We sometimes go out with him.    2009年、友人の家の庭で野良猫のお母さんが生んだ４匹の仔猫の１匹を引き取りハルと名付けました。母猫は短毛でしたが、なぜかハルだけもしゃもしゃの長毛の仔猫でした。ハルは落ち着いて好奇心のある猫で、私たちは時々ハルを連れてお出かけや旅行をしています！ https://www.youtube.com/user/HAL2009CAT\n",

I provide either interesting or intellectually stimulating items only. I update daily and I strive to create a completely unique place for the people who are fed up with mainstream shallow cultures. Second I DO extensive quality control. Some channels are just posting random books without any quality control to just increase books' numbers so that they can reach the status of \"Featured Channel.\" But I choose 'quality' over 'quantity' and 'uniqueness' over 'general appeal.' Thank you. PS: The picture of the book in my channel icon was taken by Dr. Marcus Gossler. I wish to express my gratitude to Dr. Marcus Gossler.

And thx for OVER 500 subscribers thats like a small militia or something and together we can be bigger than smosh nigahiga combined we are sooooo close!!! we just need like a few million more subscribers. But im 17 so im sure i can outlive them since the guys from smosh are 26 years old i believe.  BTW for some reason i have ads and commercials on some of my videos even though i disabled them since i dont care if i make money since i cant since im still underage and even though if can i will get about 10 dollars a month so it wasnt worth it and yet youtube still puts ads on my vids so wtf youtube its my channel not yours.

Her work has grown from traditional black and white photography shown in galleries and museums to public spaces with performances in the lobbies of the One World Trade Center; Port Authority Bus Terminal; TWA Terminal at JFK Airport. In 1984 #NYSCA funded a 40’ x 23’ painted mural of her photograph “Flowing Light” on 42nd Street in Times Square.  Over the years she has created videos and multi-media installations  At her 50th anniversary respective \"VISIONS OF LIGHT+SPIRIT\" at the #Westbeth Gallery NYC from May 1-21 2016 she will premiere her newest multi-media installation \"Transmigration\". Inspired by Buddha’s teachings the piece transports viewers from the big bang to the lower realms to liberation as they walk within a surreal holographic environment of ever-changing videos cast by two synchronized projectors onto the layers of diaphanous fabric.   Enjoy some video clips from #Transmigration!\n",

We set up a YouTube channel for Charlie in January 2013 as we began training him to complete tasks ranging from helpful (shutting cabinet doors) to amusing (bringing a can of beer and the TV remote straight to the couch). After our beautiful baby was born we noticed his special bond with our daughter and we began filming our canine companion as he helped us care for her.  Charlie the dog was introduced to baby Laura the moment she came home. We taught him how to help change her diapers swing her baby crib and play gently with her. But the one thing we never had to teach him is how to love our daughter. Charlie showed us how babies and dogs can be the best of friends and he demonstrates that he is an important part of our family and the unconditional love and and joy he provides is immeasurable.\n",
